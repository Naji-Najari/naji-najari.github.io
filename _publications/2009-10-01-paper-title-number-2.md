Abstract:
> Anomaly detection consists in detecting non-conforming anomalous data points. Traditional one-class-based anomaly detectors assume that the training data are anomaly-free and generated from one single class, considered the norm. The performance of these approaches significantly degrades when a ratio of outliers contaminates the training dataset. In this paper, we propose GRAnD, a training strategy robust to outliers in training data and hyperparameter selection. Based on Variational Autoencorders and Normalizing Flows, our proposal filters training outliers by means of a robust rejection strategy derived from Extreme Value Theory. Then, it leverages filtered training anomalies to improve outlier detection performance and to generalize to unseen new anomalies. Extensive experiments and sensitivity analyses on image and network traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in unsupervised anomaly detection.
