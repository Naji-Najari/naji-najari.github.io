Abstract:
> In the last decades, Internet of Things objects have been
increasingly integrated into smart environments. Nevertheless, new issues
emerge due to numerous reasons such as fraudulent attacks, inconsistent
sensor behaviours, and network congestion. These anomalies can have a
drastic impact on the global Quality of Service in the Local Area Network.
Consequently, contextual anomaly detection using network traffic meta-
data has received a growing interest among the scientific community. The
detection of temporal anomalies helps network administrators anticipate
and prevent such failures. In this paper, we propose RESIST, a Robust
transformEr developed for unSupervised tIme Series anomaly deTection.
We introduce a robust learning strategy that trains a Transformer to
model the nominal behaviour of the network activity. Unlike competing
methods, our approach does not require the availability of an anomaly-
free training subset. Relying on a contrastive learning-based robust loss
function, RESIST automatically downweights atypical corrupted training
data, to reduce their impact on the training optimization. Experiments
on the CICIDS17 public benchmark dataset show an improved accuracy
of our proposal in comparison to recent state-of-the-art methods.
